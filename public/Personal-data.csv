There are stories of supposedly good dragons that once lad armies of men against evil.  Dwanhaven even has a supposed dragon protector but they have not been seen in written history.  It is now just a story and most don’t believe it.  The dragons were banished back to their realm when the Riftborn died.

Dawnhaven’s story of a protector dragon comes from a supposed statue of one in the middle squat of the city

It actually extracts life an vitality from a person somewhere and is concentrated down and mixed with other sources, into a concentrate.

73,Where did the good dragons go?,"Dragons:  when the devoted killed the Riftborn there was some popular support.  The metallic dragons were disgusted by the actions of the humanoid races and chose to go into deep hibernation, turning to stone.  The world generally believes there are no such thing as good dragons, and good dragons are but a myth or a kids story.  But there is one silver dragon left called The Watcher, who is watching and waiting for a time when the humanoid races have matured enough to realize the error of their ways, and for a time when the world will need the aid of the metallic dragons.  The Watcher will roar a wake up call to call the metallic dragons back to life, breaking free of their stone slumber to come to the aid of the world.  But only the worthy can ask The Watcher to do this.

The dragons went into hibernation because of the prophecy that one day the riftborn would return via the chosen (although the part via the chosen is not clear to those who read the prophecy, it just claims that the riftborn will return one day, after many ages have passed).

The good dragons were put into a slumber.  Perhaps because they are part of the Riftborn power.  Without the active Riftborn power they fall asleep into statues.  Do the pcs encounter statues of good dragons.  PCs discover one and wake it up
There are stories of supposedly good dragons that once lad armies of men against evil.  Dwanhaven even has a supposed dragon protector but they have not been seen in written history.  It is now just a story and most don’t believe it.  The dragons were banished back to their realm when the Riftborn died.

This is why they started to be pirates, to keep the seas clear around the hidden stone so nobody would discover it
"
75,Attack on Waterdeep,"The final place to fit the stones of power together is in Waterdeep.  The horde of the devoted is descending on Waterdeep to destroy the city and its inhabitants, but the steward of Waterdeep is too proud to ask Dawnhaven for help.  But there was once a great alliance between Waterdeep and Dawnhaven, as both are the inheritors of the squires of the Riftborn.  A great signaling system stretches across the land between the two and is maintained but nobody believes will ever be used.  The PCs need to sneak into Waterdeep and secretly activate the signal fires to request the aid of the powerful military of Dawnhaven.   All the while, it is a race against time to get the stones of power to Waterdeep for the alignment ritual before the hordes of evil arrive.  Need to hold off the evil while the ritual is completed to seal off Taeleran from the far realm and azathoth."

90,The Waking plague,"Waking plague.  Afflicted eyes turn milky white and they can’t sleep.  Not dreaming or sleeping pushes awareness to new heights, seeing patterns in snowflakes and air currents, solving generations old problems of maths and engineering.  But not sleeping or dreaming comes at a cost - lose humanity, slowly turning into intelligent undead as the body withers away and do not perceive others as human, just as cattle and beneath you.  Initially normal humanoids want to get the power of the waking plague, but then start to fear it as they see the afflicted die or undertake terrible experiments.  Kind of like becoming a lich.  A lich plague?
"

So if one of them ever dies, they just wake up in a new body.  This makes them functionally immortal, like The Comte de St Germain.  The location of the cloning facility is ultra top secret and is hidden within a continual storm in the sky.

They fought for the privilege of mounting Whisper. There was a time when Whisper faced the eye. A time when, I think, Whisper died and was resurrected, died and was resurrected, till she became intimate with death. There were times when she was tortured. And another time with the eye. The fragments I retain suggest that she was shattered, slain, revived, and reassembled as a devoted slave. I recall her pledge of fealty to the Lady. Her voice dripped a craven eagerness to please.

"
106,The major wards,"The Riftborn relics/sanctums protect the material plane from the dark dimension.  If they fall the dark dimension will flow forth.
The Riftborn held back the demons of the rift.  Many of the wards were damaged when the Riftborn died.  Once they were gone the demons started to come through.  Demons now terrorize the world. Worlds End is a village that faces a continuous stream of demons from the rift outside the village.  An endless war centered around the village.

For they have no honor and thus must be raiders (for warriors are the lowest level of the orc society).  
The orcs live in the desert wastes and the unoccupied grasslands.  Different tribes in different areas, with different skin colors.  Green skin orcs in grasslands, red skin or “fire skin” orcs in the desert.  Nomadic raiders.  Said to be some whiteskin orcs in the frozen north.

For casting mighty spells, and stirring up the brew,
Impressing fair young maidens, middle-aged women too,
Even older ladies find its power quite true!

A wizard’s staff has a knob on the end,
It’s big and round and long, my friend,
With a swish and a flick, it makes the magic bend,
A wizard’s staff has a knob on the end!
Verse 2:
In the darkest of caves or the highest of towers,
The staff stands firm, showing off its powers,
But to keep it strong, you’ve got to treat it right,
Rub it vigorously, massage it every night!
Chorus:
A wizard’s staff has a knob on the end,
It’s big and round and long, my friend,
With a swish and a flick, it makes the magic bend,
A wizard’s staff has a knob on the end!

It feels so good when others lay hands,
On your sturdy staff, as it travels across the lands,
But remember this truth, as it always returns,
To the hands it trusts, where the magic burns!

From the depths of the forest to the bustling inn,
The staff’s always handy, causing quite a din,
With special oils, and a loving touch,
A wizard’s staff stays powerful, thank you very much!
Chorus:
A wizard’s staff has a knob on the end,
It’s big and round and long, my friend,
With a swish and a flick, it makes the magic bend,
A wizard’s staff has a knob on the end!

A wizard’s staff is the best around,
In the right hands, it erupts with great might,
A wizard’s staff has a knob, shining bright!

258,The Adventurers Guild,"The Guild has guild houses in most large towns across Taeleran, having spread over the past millennia (it is a very old organisation).  The guild has significant commercial interests across the myriad civilisations  ranging from performing contract work for others (from recovery of lost property, persons, to acting as hired muscle/protection, and even as a milita for hire if you have enough coin).  The Guild also has ownership interests in most of the large commercial organizations of Taeleran.  However the main focus of activity for the Guild is completing internal contracts to discover and recover treasures from the wilds of the land, and make more of the wild lands known, understood, safe and most importantly controlled.
The guild is held in high regard as an honourable organisation.  They help to keep the wheels of commerce turning across the land, and often support the governments of the lands, performing services on a contract basis, so the rulers of most places are keen to have the adventurers guild working in their lands.  In these poor times you feel lucky to have the opportunity to work for them.  Plus the coin is good.
The Adventurers Guild’s stated purpose is to discover and retrieve the treasures from the uncharted wilds and ruins of the far away lost lands, bringing fresh wealth to the civilisations of the land and keeping the wheels of commerce turning.  "

,Sky Knights of the Ashard,"The Order of the Ashard is a prestigious and ancient organization of skyborne knights who patrol the skies astride majestic flying mounts. These knights are renowned for their unwavering sense of justice, their mastery of aerial combat, and their commitment to protecting the realms below from airborne and terrestrial threats alike.
The order takes its name from Ashard, a good ancient dragon said to have forged a pact with the first knights to ensure the safety of the skies. Legend holds that Ashard gifted the knights with knowledge of taming and bonding with flying mounts, before vanishing into the heavens.
The order was established during a time of chaos when sky raiders and dragon cults terrorized the lands. Since that time, finding mounts has become increasingly difficult, as has recruitment - who wants to put themselves at risk for people they don’t know?  Self interest has increased and has made recruitment difficult.  As a result, the order is a smaller force than it once was, and has retracted its area of operations to the immediate region surrounding their fortress..
Tenets of the Order
* The knights of the Ashard adhere to a strict code of conduct, summarized in the Five Winds:
* The Wind Protects: Defend the innocent from harm, no matter the cost.
* The Wind Guides: Lead by example, showing wisdom and humility in all actions.
* The Wind Strikes: Deliver swift justice to those who threaten peace.
* The Wind Endures: Hold firm against adversity, as the sky holds firm against the storm.
* The Wind Unites: Work as one with allies, mounts, and the forces of nature.
The Order of the Ashard is forgotten by most, and they can only field a force large enough to protect the immediate area around their fortress.  Where they have a presence though they serve as protectors of the skies, patrolling trade routes, battling airborne threats, and intervening in disputes where justice is at stake.  They remain neutral in political affairs unless innocents are directly endangered.

,Holy Overbite the dentist warlock,"Holy Overbite grew up in Sweetmeadow, a town steeped in sugar and decay, with a father (Denton Overbite) obsessed with climbing the corporate ladder at the local candy factory and a mother (Eloise) whose life was consumed by poor health caused by an all-candy diet. Desperate to save his mother, Holy turned to self-taught dentistry, practicing on stray dogs and unintentionally giving them unsettlingly perfect smiles, which led to his exile from the town. After his mother’s death and driven by guilt and a vision of purity, Holy found purpose through Molarmo, the eldritch Patron of Smiles, vowing to combat dental neglect and decay wherever he went. Now, he roams the land as a zealous healer, armed with magical tools and an unrelenting obsession to bring perfect smiles to all—even as  he uncovers a darker truth: his estranged father has become a key figure in a shadowy faction profiting from the very decay Holy seeks to destroy.  Molarmo seeks teeth for an unknowable reason, and is in fact the boss of the Tooth Fairy, an actual fairy, who is a warlock just like Holy"

However, Percy found an amulet amongst the possessions of this mother long after she died, that revealed that she was in fact a high cleric of Bahamut, part of a small order who continued to workshop and serve bahamut.  When Percy discovered this, he decided to find out more, and was visited in a dream by Bahamut.  Percy swore himself to Bahamut as his paladin.  The status of the order that Percy's mother belonged to is unknown.  (Unknown to the players, there is a single cleric of Bahamut still alive, in hiding.

,Panabis,
,Barryl,
,Rohandsy's character,"# ✨ Rohandsey – High Elf Cleric
* **Race & Class:** High Elf Cleric
* **Personality:** Charismatic, eccentric, and permanently a bit dazed. He balances between tragic and comedic, haunted by his past while stumbling forward in a concussed haze.

## 🌄 Early Life in the Mountains
Rohandsey was born in a poor, high-elf town deep in the mountains. As a teenager he began wearing **women’s clothing**, not out of preference at first, but because they were cheaper. This made him an outsider, mocked by the townsfolk.
At 14, he had a fling with a girl, who fell pregnant. To protect her from her strict religious family, Rohandsey **pretended he had given birth to the baby himself**. Combined with his eccentric clothing, the townsfolk believed a **miracle had occurred** and that he was touched by God.

## 🕯️ From Miracle to Messiah
This “miracle” drew him into the town’s secretive, “classier” orgies, where his reputation grew. By his 16th summer, Rohandsey was dabbling in alchemy, creating **crude methamphetamines** that he fed to fellow revelers. The drugs caused memory loss, and when women later discovered themselves pregnant, the village believed Rohandsey was responsible for a series of **virgin births**.
Rohandsey’s fame snowballed—he became a living **prophet-figure**, revered by many, feared by some.

## 🎪 The World Rohandsey Festival Disaster
His notoriety culminated in a series of gatherings known as the **World Rohandsey Festivals**. At the fourth, Rohandsey arrived late—by then, all his followers had taken a bad batch of his meth. Every one of them was dead by the time he appeared, including the mother of his child.
Overwhelmed and terrified, Rohandsey **abandoned his toddler** and fled. The survivors of his hometown were furious, demanding he pay **parenting costs** and restitution for the disaster.

## 🚶 Life on the Run
Since then, Rohandsey has drifted from town to town, funding his escape through **meth-cooking and small-time cult manipulation**. His body and mind bear the scars: he lives in a **permanent, mildly concussed state** from years of drug use.
To cover himself, and perhaps to redeem himself, he took up the mantle of a **cleric**. His faith is a strange mixture of genuine devotion and self-delusion: is he truly chosen, or just a fraud with divine magic? Even he doesn’t fully know.


## 🎭 Present Motivations
* **Redemption or Escape:** Rohandsey travels with the Piss Bandits partly to do good, partly to hide from those chasing him.
* **Fear of the Past:** He is constantly looking over his shoulder, waiting for debts, abandoned family, or old followers to reappear.
* **Dangerous Knowledge:** His cult and drug history give him a twisted insight into how manipulation and altered states of mind shape belief—knowledge that makes him oddly useful against Far Realm cults like the Purple Robes.

## 🎲 The Rohandsey Trouble Table
Rohandsey’s past is never far behind. When you want chaos to catch up to him, roll a **d8**:
| d8 | Trouble                  | Description & Hook                                                                                                        |
| -- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1  | **Debt Collector**       | A bounty hunter or priest demands “parenting costs” for the abandoned child. They threaten trial or seize gear if unpaid. |  Effect: Rohandsey must pay 100 gp per level or risk trial/seizure of equipment.
| 2  | **Fanatical Follower**   | An ex-follower arrives, treating Rohandsey as a messiah and loudly spreading his gospel.|  Effect: Rohandsey makes a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) check to defuse the chaos, or the follower draws a mob’s attention.
| 3  | **The Abandoned Child**  | His child (now older) appears, demanding answers—or repayment in gold, blood, or love.|  Effect: The child demands either 500 gp in support or a quest of atonement. If refused, they may become a recurring rival.
| 4  | **Bad Batch**            | Someone finds one of Rohandsey’s old meth recipes; deaths or visions ensue, and the party gets blamed.|  Effect: Rohandsey makes a DC 14 Medicine or Arcana check to stabilize victims. Failure earns the party disfavor with local authorities.
| 5  | **Festival Survivor**    | A villager who lived through World Rohandsey Festival 4 seeks vengeance—or wants to crown him again.|  Effect: 50% chance they’re out for vengeance, 50% chance they want to restore Rohandsey’s cult.
| 6  | **Cult Revival**         | A splinter sect has restarted World Rohandsey Festivals. They want him to lead—or they’ll force him.|  Effect: If refused, they attempt a hostile kidnapping ritual at night.
| 7  | **Concussive Flashback** | Rohandsey relives his drug-fueled past mid-adventure, blurting secrets or performing cult rituals by mistake.|  Effect: For the next 1d4 hours, he has disadvantage on Insight and Concentration checks, but advantage on Performance (as he relives “godhood”).
| 8  | **Fey Tie-In**           | Whispers call him “the Twice-Born.” A Fey Lord takes interest, sending agents to “return him home.” |  Effect: Treat as a CR-appropriate Fey encounter, with Rohandsey as the target. Negotiation may drag the whole party into fae bargains.

## ⚖️ Core Themes in His Story
* **Accidental Prophet:** Once seen as divine, now a wandering ex-messiah who can’t escape his legend.
* **Responsibility Avoided:** Haunted by the child he abandoned and the deaths of his followers.
* **Faith vs. Falsehood:** Unsure whether his current divine calling is real—or just another high.
* **Comedy and Tragedy:** His permanent dazed state makes him ridiculous, but his story carries real pathos.

This version makes Rohandsey’s backstory **tragic, absurd, and gameable**—with the **Trouble Table** serving as a DM’s toolkit to keep his past crashing into the present."
,Great crystals that float in the sky,"There are several giant crystals that float high in the sky among the clouds.  They move around the world, as though they may float on the wind. It is hard to know how many there are as they move.  There may be 100 or so or maybe only 20.

Gargantuan crystals float through the air, approx 100m tall, 20m wide, tapered towards the top.  Nobody knows how many there are as they move around randomly and look alike, but estimates sit between 20 and 40 across the world.  Some appear to be damaged with cracks across their surface, and some with whole pieces missing.  They have been there as long as written history.  Nobody knows their purpose, but there are theories. 
Theories:
- They make the rain -  some people pray for one to appear and bring rain
- They bring wind and storms -  and their coming means a storm is coming
- A great long lost empire built them then forgot about them
- They are not of this world -  they got lost from another dimension
- They charge up the lightning

Secret:  they are power packs for the Riftborn -  by attuning to one, grants a deep well of arcane power to call on (like giant spell slots).  Used to power 20th level magic.  If you attune to one it will gradually travel towards you then hover above you.  Once attuned you can turn it invisible so that it does not give your location away.  Attuning to it gives you 5 9th level spell slots

What an NPC knows:
- There are several () of these giant floating crystals around the world. I once saw two of them hanging near each other, a deep red one, and a light blue one.
- They all are different colours -  don’t know why they would have different colours.  But you can use them to identify them
- People have nicknamed them - red ones are known as blood blades, blue one are sky dreams, green ones is Sylvanus’ Spires, yellow ones are ____, violet one are viridian flowers, orange ones are sun spires _____, black ones are nightmares because they seem to crackle with malevolent energy.
- Some show signs of damage -  cracks, great rents in their sides, cratered surface
- Current count is 22 -  but not confirmed, because they move around the world randomly, almost with the wind, but not quite."
,Common knowledge of the Forerunners,"What people in the world believe about the Forerunners
- An ancient race of beings who are said to have commanded great magical power.
- Not sure that they were actually a race or were they multiple races.  Skeletons have been unearthed in known Forerunner archaeological sites that looked a lot like the peoples of Taeleran today - humans, dwarves, elves, gnomes etc.  
- Left behind great engineering structures - great bridges and dams, massive buildings on mountain peaks - things that could not be built today - the knowledge and engineering techniques and even magic has been lost.
- No trace of what happened to them.  It seems that one day they just disappeared off the face of the planet.
- When they left, there is evidence that their departure unleashed a great magical outburst that left significant scars on the landscape - created massive canyons, craters, sent chunks of earth into the sky and they have remained there floating. Some say the Dark Lands were created by this cataclysm.
- They have left behind several great magic items and a few texts that are the basis of all we know about them - other than children’s stories and myths and legends (although myths often begin with a seed of truth). 
- Nobody knows where their magical power came from - arcane scholars believe their magic may not have been of the weave of magic as we use today for all forms of magic on Taeleran.

,The Darklands,"Here’s what the PCs would know about The Darklands (generally held knowledge of the world):
An area racked by intense volcanic and geological activity, great storms and gravitic impacts.  Nobody can live there, for most who venture there do not return.  Only a few have survived to return and told of the chaos within.  Lightning cracks regularly, and some of it is a menacing red.
Storms cover the entire sky, making it dim everywhere, hence the name.
Boulders float and huge earthmotes have been lifted out of the ground.  Pieces of rock get thrown around by the gravity storm and the winds, smashing down into the ground.  There is also regular storms of minor pebbles, rattling into the ground like a hail of bullets.  Like a cross between the elemental plane of air and earth and fire, and ice. Seasons switch at a moment, from extreme heat, to icy cold
A great storm sits constantly above the Unknown Lands, called The Everstorm.  It stays in place."
,A Forerunner magic item,"Can't work out how to use it, but able to make it do just one thing that is miraculous e.g. float and defy gravity for a time.  It is kind of bulky."
,Rent goblins.,"Goblins rent themselves out either as fighters, or as bum boys.  They will do anything for a shiny coin.  They don't consider it degrading, it's just work."
,The Wardens of the Void,"Gundren Rockseeker is a member, though just a lowly member, a Seeker, of an ancient sacred order.  They call themselves the Wardens of the Void, and they search out and protect the Forerunner’s lost wisdom, relics, and teachings.  They believe that one day, when the world needs them most, the Forerunners will return to claim their legacy and lead the world forth into a golden age. Until that day, the Wardens of the Void stand as silent sentinels, ensuring this knowledge does not fall into the hands of the unworthy.  
The Wardens began as squires to the Knights Radiant of the Forerunners, serving them and supporting them.  When they disappeared from the land, we took up the mission of preserving their legacy so it will be here when they eventually return.
Name comes from the mission of the Forerunners themselves.  The forerunners protected the world from a great threat from the far realm - from the great void space of insanity and unreality.  We continue this responsibility, although much of the knowledge of the forerunners has been lost and we fear we may be losing the battle.  There are rifts across the world.  They are warded to stop entities coming through.  But the order has lost the knowledge to make and maintain the wards.  They seek out rumours of old forerunner caches and archives.
The order's name has changed many times over thousands of years.
Gundren has the symbol of the order tattooed on the inside of his arm.
Percy’s sword has a symbol of the order -  it is an old symbol, not used for many thousands of years, but bears a likeness to our current symbol (below) -  old symbol on percy’s sword seen second below.. The two runes at the bottom represent knowledge and duty: the twin pillars - to preserve the knowledge, and the duty to protect it and keep it hidden from those who would use it for evil.
There is a prophecy that the Forerunners will return one day, when the world needs them most.  And we must protect their secrets until then from those who would use them for evil.  This is the sacred mission of the Wardens.
A chapter house is in Dawnhaven.  THey say the city was built by the Forerunners themselves.  It is a beautiful city, led by the queen
